I've worked with Dan on a number of projects now and without hesitation he is one of the suppliers I most enjoy working with. He takes all the stress out of projects for me - explains everything in a way which I understand and keeps the projects running far more smoothly than I could ever manage. His work is always faultless, he has incredible attention to detail and top communication skills. You can find many talented developers but the ones that are as organised and as pro-active as Dan are priceless. I don't know what I'd do without him.
