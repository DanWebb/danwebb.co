Dan has been the most joyous web developer I've ever had the pleasure to work with – my usual response to developer emails is opening them with eyes half hidden behind my hands, but each of his emails has left me with a huge smile. Nothing has been too much trouble, time is taken to graciously ensure everything is explained simply and in an easy to understand manner. Projects that once filled me with dread and ate into more than my budgeted time can now be elegantly managed, designed and built – I finally feel I can offer clients the websites they deserve, and in a stress free and profitable way.

Honestly, hire him, a thousand times over. I could not be more impressed and more thankful for his management, understanding, clarity, and of course his beautiful development skills.
