summary: Rachael is an advanced franklin method educator helping people access the body of their dreams. I developed a paid members only courses area through a custom registration process and Stripe integration as well as a bespoke sales website. Both are backed by Prismic CMS to flexibly and intuitively manage all content from a single location.
